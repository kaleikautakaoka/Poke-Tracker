## Overview
```
Poke-Tracker is a full-stack application that allows users to search for Pokemon and add them to their team. Users may also make donations to the Poke-Tracker team to help keep the site running. Inspiration for this app was to build our own Pokedex. In the show Pokemon a Pokedex is used to show information on a pokemon. In order to relive our childhood we made one. This will be a more modern version of it. This app allows users to search a Pokemon by their name and add them to their list which can be used to keep track of caught Pokemon. Poke-Tracker will help you not only have the latest information available
for your Pokemon, but will make them easy to track.
